Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Cyber Forensics Researcher | Tool Developer

I am a passionate and fast learner in the field of cybersecurity, specializing in cyber forensics and investigative work. With a focus on utilizing a variety of tools for recon, research, and hands-on practice, I am always exploring new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I’ve developed tools like recon_scanner to support my reconnaissance work, and I continue to dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity, especially within the forensics segment.

My favorite operating systems include Kali Linux, Caine OS, and BlackArch Linux—all essential in my work. I am continuously learning and adapting to new challenges in this ever-evolving field. Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places whenever I get the chance.
